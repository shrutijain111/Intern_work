Problems faced while Integrating flask and pyppeteer:
* raise RuntimeError('There is no current event loop in thread %r.’)
    * We can’t initialise asyncio.get_event_loop() after starting the flask app, as the app.run() returns the flask development server
* signal only works in main thread of the main interpreter
    * Due to the interaction between Pyppeteer's usage of signals and the threading model of Flask.  Flask, by default, runs in a multi-threaded environment to handle multiple requests concurrently, which can interfere with the signal handling.
Solution:
	Disable the signal handling in the pyppeteer -> await launch(handleSIGINT=False,handleSIGTERM=False,handleSIGHUP=False)

Pyppeteer’s CSSCoverage is unable to extract the user agent stylesheet styles(pre-defined browser styles)
